# Ceramics
## About
The only comprehensive ceramics and clay mod out there. Ceramics are one of mankindâ€™s oldest and most versatile inventions, predating the establishment of civilization itself. It allowed mankind to create durable, water tight containers and to record the first written word on clay tablets. An endlessly useful material, clay can be shaped into bricks and fired to construct strong, fireproof walls, or shaped into beautiful sculptures. With advanced technologies, it can even be formed into precise electronics or durable armor.
Ceramics adds clay and clayworking to Rimworld. This offers not only an early fireproof construction material in the form of simple mud bricks, but also a variety of more advanced materials as more research is unlocked.
With the right skills and tools, your colonists can transform raw materials into cutting-edge equipment, like advanced electronics and durable body armor.
